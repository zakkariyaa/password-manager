# How it works:
- User creates an account before they can utilize the functionalities of the website.<br />
If they already registered, they will be logged atomatically. Info is stored in local storage.<br /><br />

- They can add passwords they want to save, edit or delete existing ones<br />
or generate totally new passwords.<br /><br />

- User can use search to find passwords (have to put the name exactly as stored).<br /><br />

# Limitations
- The authentication is pretty rudimentary and only allows one user per browser.<br /><br />
- The search functionality is not intuitive as it requires the exact same name to find passwords.<br /><br />

# Features
1- Client side authentication functionality (registartion and login)<br /><br />
